# Godot3DGame
My first 3D game In Godot

## ✔️ Overview   

This game was developed to study GDScript and Godot

Followed the [tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html)

I added a few things too:
--Pause Screen
--Sound effect for jump, start, game over and kill an enemy
--Took out all the harded code variables from the tutorial
--Added a function to change from degrees to radians
--Increased speed of the enemies over time
--Max score with the use of resources
